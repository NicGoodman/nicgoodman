            text: 'For the past eight years, I managed my own design and development firm in Asheville, North Carolina. This has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life. I started ninebar as primarily a graphic design-oriented firm. However, since I taught myself BASIC on my graphing calculator as a middle schooler, I have had a strong interest in coding, and I have been trying to live professionally in the space where design and development overlap.'

            text: 'I grew up working for my family''s manufacturing business, doing everything from graphic design to running CNC machines producing lug nuts. I went on to earn a degree from the University of North Carolina Asheville in Multimedia Arts & Sciences. It was essentially a study of the confluence of design, computer engineering, and digital art. This multidisciplinary education carried over into my career. Out of college, I learned the production side of traditional print media. I worked in a print shop for five years.  I designed print materials for clients and walked them through the design process.  After learning the production equipment, I also started producing customer''s work, everything from business cards to multi-story sized banners.'

            text: 'While working at the print shop, I started my firm, ninebar. It started as a collaborative collective of freelancers and quickly grew to be a full-service design firm. Our founding partners came from different backgrounds like architecture and photography, but all had a foot in design. I love to learn new things and see how I can apply them to help others, so shortly into ninebar''s history, I decided to expand our services beyond branding and design. We started developing beautiful websites that were not just boilerplate Squarespace or WordPress templates. That is when I taught myself Craft, Twig, and learned of Tailwind. Since then, I have grown that skillset with every project and taken advantage of being someone who designs the product and develops and ships it.'

            text: 'My education and career have always been about exploring and taking advantage of the space where design and development, two traditionally separate fields, overlap. From my experience with your products, this is the space where Tailwind Labs sits and thrives. I feel strongly that designers that know how to code can produce well informed UX/UI. And I think coders that know something about design will produce better code. I believe that producing websites and apps that are smart and considerate can help our digital society. Tailwind Labs embodies that philosophy and produces resources, tools, and techniques that democratize good clean design for the masses. That is a goal that I believe in strongly, and '

Over the years, I maintained their brand, making aesthetic changes and producing the occasional flyer and business card. In the spring of 2020, they asked for a new inventory management based website that incorporated a refreshed look. I updated their identity and took them through a full web design process, starting with a series of components and site comps that culminated in a fully mocked-up user flow and site design. I took that end result and then developed and shipped a Craft CMS site using HTML, CSS (via Tailwind), Twig, and Alpine.js.'

My team and I developed a font hierarchy, color palette, and asset style that was then used to develop a new inventory based site with a specialized wishlist system for prospective customers. We did a full design process, and I took the final set of comps to develop and ship a Craft CMS site build with HTML, CSS (again with the help of Tailwind), Twig, Alpine.js, and Sprig/HTMX for some reactivity.'

Because I could experiment and take some risks, I decided to learn Statamic 3 and, with its static site generator addon, host the site statically on Netlify. And because it seemed like fun, I decided to learn and use some Vue.js for reactivity and give the site a little SPA magic. Of course, the rest is built on HTML, CSS (you guessed it, via Tailwind), and Antlers.'

It is absolutely ridiculous, over the top, and we had a lot of fun making it.'
