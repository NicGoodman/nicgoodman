        text: 'I started working with Burial Beer Co. in the summer of 2019. The Asheville brewery was looking for a brand director and ninebar stepped in as the interim team during that search. We spearheaded the design and production of all of the brewery''s design materials and worked with their illustrator David Paul Seymour to produce beautiful and unique packaging for their beer.'
