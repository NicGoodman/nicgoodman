        text: "In the summer of 2014, Boss Lady Bitters asked my team at ninebar to develop an Identity Package for their new company and to design packaging for their line of cocktail bitters. We took the approach of thinking about the packaging first and developed a logo that shined on both a bottle label and on the back of an envelope.\_"
