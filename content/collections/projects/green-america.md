        text: 'ninebar has worked with Green America to design campaign brands, print materials, infographics, and reports since 2017. The campaigns I designed brands for have reduced receipt paper usage, gotten telecommunication companies to commit to greenhouse gas emission goals, and forced universities to look at their paper usage.'
