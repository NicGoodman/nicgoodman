        text: 'Frank Vogler with V&V Land Management was one of my clients when I worked in the print industry. When I started ninebar, Frank reached out for my design services, having me develop print materials such as brochures, business cards, portfolios, and vehicle graphics. In the Fall of 2018, he asked for me to redesign his WordPress site and develop that new site on a platform. I used Craft CMS, Tailwind CSS, and JQuery to build that new, streamlined, and easier to consume website.'
