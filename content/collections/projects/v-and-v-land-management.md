        text: 'Frank Vogler with V&V Land Management was one of my clients when I worked in the print industry. When I started ninebar, Frank reached out for my design services, where I developed print materials such as brochures, business cards, portfolios, and vehicle graphics. In the Fall of 2018, he asked for a website redesign. I used his older WordPress site to develop a new site on a new platform. I used Craft CMS, Tailwind CSS, and JQuery to build a new, streamlined, and easier to consume website.'
