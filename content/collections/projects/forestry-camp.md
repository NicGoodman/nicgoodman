        text: 'I started working with Forestry Camp in the summer of 2019. I lead the prototyping and design of their grand opening website and then built a Craft CMS based site using Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS. While the site was in development, I also designed a physical menu system for their indoor dining service and other various marketing materials including business cards, greeting cards, and signage. Since the start of the pandemic, I have also built out QR code-based digital menus and a new streamlined homepage experience for Forestry Camp.'
