        text: 'Rise Over Run Wine approached ninebar in 2017 to work on updates to their distributor''s wine list. That process forced us to design a basic identity for their brand which we then used to design and develop a new site. Initially, Rise Over Run Wine wanted a simple Squarespace site. During development though, they asked for a robust inventory integration driven by Google Sheets. This forced us to switch over to Craft CMS which allowed them to continue to manage their inventory in Google Sheets and have that inventory be reflected on their new site. I also used Tailwind CSS in the development of this site.'
