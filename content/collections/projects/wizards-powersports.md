        text: 'During the summer of 2013, I was approached by Wizards Powersports and at ninebar, lead the development of an identity package for the company based on a low-resolution bitmapped icon of a wizard provided by the client. After wrapping up that initial project, I maintained a working relationship with Wizards, and continued to refine their identity and produced assets at various times.'

        text: 'In the spring of 2020, I was approached to replace their aging Squarespace site with an inventory driven Craft CMS based website. I took that opportunity to update their aesthetic and design their new web presence using Adobe XD. I took that prototype and used it to develop their new Craft CMS site using Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS for additional light reactivity. I currently help maintain their site and continue to produce assets when needed.'
