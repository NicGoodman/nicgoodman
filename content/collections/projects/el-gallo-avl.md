        text: 'El Gallo AVL is a new restaurant that opened up in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was asked to take their already developed brand and design a manageable web presence that could drive sales during a difficult time. They also wanted the option of E-Commerce and, to save costs, wanted to run this site alongside another owned property. I chose Craft CMS with Commerce Lite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine JS. I used Craft''s multisite capabilities so that the one instance could drive the multiple restaurants.'
