        text: 'When El Gallo AVL opened, Imperíal also underwent a rebrand. I was asked to use that new brand to develop a site that coexisted with El Gallo AVL. I designed a similar site structure and UX/UI that complimented El Gallo and then developed that site to run under the El Gallo Craft CMS multisite instance. This site also utilized Craft Commerce Lite, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine JS.'
