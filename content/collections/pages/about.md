During the past eight years at ninebar, grew a basic coding skillset into a robust portfolio of different web development technologies, principles, and techniques. I am always looking for the next language or framework that I can use to satisfy clients.'

        text: 'I started ninebar in 2012 alongside two friends as a way to part-time freelance. Since then, ninebar grew in size, our portfolio of services has expanded and made the jump to operating full-time from an office in downtown Asheville. My experience in the traditional print design field and running production machines in the print industry informs my design sensibilities as Creative Director. I spearheaded efforts to expand our web development offerings and my experience as a graphic designer has given me a unique perspective when it comes to web design and development.'
