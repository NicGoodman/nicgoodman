        text: 'Owning and running your business requires a lot of on the job problem solving and self-motivation when it comes to learning new skills and professional development. During the past eight years at ninebar, I have grown a basic coding skillset out of college into a robust portfolio of different web development technologies, principles and techniques. I am always looking for the next language or framework to start learning and to see how I can apply it in a way that makes my clients happy.'

        text: 'ninebar was started by two of my friends and me who enjoyed doing freelance work in our free time. From 2012 onward, our business grew in size, our portfolio of services expanded, and we operated out of a great office in the heart of downtown Asheville. My experience in the traditional print design field and running production machines in the print industry helped inform my design sensibilities early on as Creative Director. As our services grew, I spearheaded efforts to expand our web development offerings and my experience as a graphic designer gave me a unique perspective when it came to web design and development.'
