## Hi, I'm Nic!

I am a professionally trained graphic designer, UX/UI designer, and web developer. I have a keen eye for fun and modern design. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding, and tackle complications with vigor and excitement. I have become adept at communicating effectively through extensive work experience dealing with various types of clients.

I own and run my own business, ninebar, which requires on-the-job-problem solving and self-motivation when it comes to learning new skills and professional development. During the past eight years at ninebar, grew a basic coding skillset into a robust portfolio of different web development technologies, principles, and techniques. I am always looking for the next language or framework that I can use to satisfy clients.

I started ninebar in 2012 alongside two friends as a way to part-time freelance. Since then, ninebar grew in size, our portfolio of services has expanded and made the jump to operating full-time from an office in downtown Asheville. My experience in the traditional print design field and running production machines in the print industry informs my design sensibilities as Creative Director. I spearheaded efforts to expand our web development offerings and my experience as a graphic designer has given me a unique perspective when it comes to web design and development.

I pride myself in being one of those rare designers that is capable of and thoroughly enjoys coding, as well as being a coder who still gets really excited over a new branding and identity packages for companies big and small. 

### What I'm learning
I am currently working on improving my Vue.js 3 and TypeScript skillsets and actively trying to work those technologies into new projects.
